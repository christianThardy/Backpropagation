This script fits a three-layer, feed-forward neural network with seven neurons(pink) to a complex curve(green) using backpropagation implemented from scratch.

The algorithm is constructed using functions that calculate the Jacobian of the loss function and its partial derivatives wrt the weights and biases of the network.

The activation function _σ_(z), and its derivative _σ'_(z), which is a function to initialize the weights and biases, are also defined.
